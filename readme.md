- Manage user schedules and notifications.

### Setting Up

# Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance set up and running.
- Supabase project created.

git clone https://https://github.com/OpenSource-GH/dumsor-tracker-api.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd dumsor-tracker-api`

### Application Workflow
- Authentication: The application will require authentication. Users can view data without creating an account, but will have to create one to post data.

- Reporting Power Outages: Users can report power outages by visiting the application and providing the following details:
  - Location
  - Power Status: Whether the user has electricity or not.

This streamlined approach will allow for easy data submission and help in tracking and analyzing power outage trends effectively.
